# number-of-cluster-for-KMeans
The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares. This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. In this section we'll see two algorithm that can use for determine the number of optimal cluster.
